# Product Links Feature - DISABLED

## Status: Feature Disabled ‚è∏Ô∏è

The product URL search feature has been **disabled** due to insufficient results and performance issues.

## Why It's Disabled

### Issues Encountered
1. **Low Success Rate**: ~15% with static scraping, ~0% with Playwright in real-world testing
2. **Slow Performance**: Playwright searches took 5-10 seconds each
3. **Poor Quality**: Many incorrect matches or failed searches
4. **Modern Web Reality**: Most Dutch supermarkets use JavaScript SPAs that require browser automation

### What We Tried

**Phase 1: Static HTML Scraping**
- ‚úÖ Fast (< 1 second per search)
- ‚ùå Only works for server-rendered sites (Jumbo)
- ‚ùå Albert Heijn blocks automated requests
- ‚ùå LIDL, Plus, Dirk, HEMA use JavaScript SPAs

**Phase 2: Smart Query Optimization**
- ‚úÖ Multiple query variations per wine
- ‚úÖ Removes numbers for Albert Heijn
- ‚úÖ Fuzzy matching validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Improved to 15% but still too low

**Phase 3: Playwright Browser Automation**
- ‚úÖ Can execute JavaScript
- ‚úÖ Bypasses some anti-bot measures
- ‚ùå Very slow (5-10 seconds per search)
- ‚ùå Still low success rate in practice
- ‚ùå Inconsistent results

## Current State

### Code Status
- ‚úÖ **All code is still in place** - ready to re-enable if needed
- ‚úÖ **Modular YAML configuration** - easy to adjust per supermarket
- ‚úÖ **Clean architecture** - 387 lines vs previous 600+ lines
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Globally disabled** via `feature_enabled: false` in config

### UI Status
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Product link button is commented out in `WineCard.jsx`
- ‚è∏Ô∏è No visible changes to users
- ‚úÖ Database schema supports `product_url` field (for future use)

## How to Re-Enable (If Needed)

### Quick Enable
```yaml
# backend/config/supermarket_search.yaml
settings:
  feature_enabled: true  # Change to true
```

### Enable UI Button
```jsx
// frontend/src/components/WineCard.jsx
// Uncomment lines 87-98
{wine.product_url && (
  <a href={wine.product_url}>...</a>
)}
```

### Enable Playwright for Specific Supermarkets
```yaml
# backend/config/supermarket_search.yaml
"Albert Heijn":
  use_playwright: true  # Change to true (if willing to accept slow performance)
```

## Alternative Solutions (For Future)

### Option 1: Manual Curation
- Build admin UI to manually add product URLs
- Target high-value/popular wines only
- Best quality, human-verified links
- **Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Estimated coverage**: 80-90% with manual work

### Option 2: Video Frame Extraction
- Your original preference!
- Extract bottle image from influencer video
- Display as wine image (not product link)
- More reliable than web scraping
- **Estimated effort**: 8-10 hours
- **User value**: Higher (see actual bottle from video)

### Option 3: Supermarket API Partnerships
- Contact supermarkets for official API access
- Requires business relationships
- Legal, reliable, fast
- **Estimated effort**: Weeks/months of negotiation

### Option 4: Accept Current State
- Focus on other features
- Wine recommendations are the core value
- Product links are nice-to-have, not essential
- **Estimated effort**: 0 hours ‚úÖ

## Recommendation

**Focus on what works:**
1. ‚úÖ Wine discovery from TikTok videos
2. ‚úÖ AI-powered extraction with transcription
3. ‚úÖ Beautiful wine cards with ratings and descriptions
4. ‚úÖ Filtering by supermarket and wine type

**Skip what doesn't:**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Automated product link scraping (low ROI)

**Consider for future:**
- üîÆ Video frame extraction for bottle images
- üîÆ Manual admin UI for curated product links

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/config/supermarket_search.yaml` - YAML configuration (disabled)
- `backend/app/services/product_search.py` - Modular search module (disabled)
- `backend/scripts/enrich_product_links.py` - Enrichment script (ready but dormant)

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/WineCard.jsx` - UI button (commented out)

### Database
- `backend/app/models.py` - Schema includes `product_url` field (unused but ready)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Modern web scraping is hard** - SPAs, anti-bot, dynamic content
2. **Perfect is the enemy of good** - 15% success rate not worth the complexity
3. **YAML configuration is great** - Easy to enable/disable features
4. **Modular code pays off** - Clean architecture even for disabled features
5. **Know when to stop** - Better to disable than ship poor quality

## Conclusion

The product link feature is **disabled but not deleted**. All the infrastructure is in place if:
- Supermarkets provide APIs in the future
- Better scraping techniques emerge
- Manual curation becomes viable
- The feature becomes essential for users

For now, we focus on what Vinly does best: **discovering great supermarket wines through TikTok influencers**.
