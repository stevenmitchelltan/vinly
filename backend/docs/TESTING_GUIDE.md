```

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**

---

### **Test 8: Duplicate Detection (post_url only)**

**Goal:** Verify post_url is the only identifier

```bash
# Test A: Same URL = Duplicate
# 1. Add a TikTok post
# 2. Try adding same URL again
# Expected: Skipped as duplicate

# Test B: Edit name doesn't create duplicate
# 1. Add a wine from URL
# 2. Edit its name in admin panel
# 3. Try adding same URL again
# Expected: Still skipped (post_url is identifier, not name)

# Test C: Different URLs = Different wines
# 1. Add wine from URL_1
# 2. Add same wine name from URL_2
# Expected: Both added (different videos = different entries)
```

**Verify in database:**
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python -c "
from pymongo import MongoClient
from app.config import settings

client = MongoClient(settings.mongodb_uri)
db = client.vinly

# Check for duplicate post_urls
from collections import Counter
urls = [w['post_url'] for w in db.wines.find()]
dupes = {k:v for k,v in Counter(urls).items() if v > 1}

print(f'Total wines: {len(urls)}')
print(f'Unique URLs: {len(set(urls))}')
print(f'Duplicate post_urls: {dupes if dupes else \"None (correct!)\"}')
"
```

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- Same post_url = duplicate detected
- Name changes don't affect duplicate detection
- No wines have duplicate post_url
- Different URLs allow same wine name

---

### **Test 9: CLI Script**

**Goal:** Test command-line wine addition

```bash
# 1. Add a wine via CLI
docker-compose exec backend python scripts/add_manual_post.py \
  "https://www.tiktok.com/@pepijn.wijn/video/7234567890123456789"

# Expected output:

# 2. Try same URL again
docker-compose exec backend python scripts/add_manual_post.py \
  "https://www.tiktok.com/@pepijn.wijn/video/7234567890123456789"

# Expected:
# - "Already in database, skipping"

# 3. Batch processing
echo "https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/111" > urls.txt
echo "https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/222" >> urls.txt

docker-compose exec backend python scripts/add_manual_post.py --file urls.txt

# Expected:
# - "Exported X wines to /docs/wines.json"
# - File size displayed

# 3. Check git diff
git diff docs/wines.json

# Expected:
# - Shows your changes
# - New/updated wine data

```

### **Test 13: Performance**

```bash

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: "Login failed" or 401 error**
```bash
# Solution: Check admin password
docker-compose logs backend | grep -i admin

# Set correct password in .env
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin

# Restart backend
docker-compose restart backend
```

### **Issue: "Wine not showing after add"**
```bash
# Solution: Refresh the wine list
Click "Refresh" button in admin panel

# Or check backend logs
docker-compose logs backend --tail=50
```

### **Issue: "Images not loading"**
```bash
# Solution: Check Cloudinary credentials
docker-compose logs backend | grep -i cloudinary

# Verify URL format
URLs should start with: https://res.cloudinary.com/
```

### **Issue: "Duplicate still created"**
```bash
# Solution: Check post_url field
docker-compose exec backend python -c "
from pymongo import MongoClient
from app.config import settings

client = MongoClient(settings.mongodb_uri)
db = client.vinly

wine = db.wines.find_one()
print('Sample wine:', wine)
print('Has post_url?', 'post_url' in wine)
"

# If post_url missing, wine was added with old system
# Re-add or manually update
```

## üìä Quick Database Inspection

**View all wines:**
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python scripts/check_wines.py
```

**Count by post_url:**
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python -c "
from pymongo import MongoClient
from app.config import settings
from collections import Counter

client = MongoClient(settings.mongodb_uri)
db = client.vinly

urls = [w.get('post_url', 'NO_URL') for w in db.wines.find()]
counts = Counter(urls)

print(f'\nTotal wines: {len(urls)}')
print(f'Unique URLs: {len(set(urls))}')
print(f'\nDuplicates (BAD if any):')
for url, count in counts.items():
    if count > 1:
        print(f'  {url}: {count} times')

if all(c == 1 for c in counts.values()):
    print('‚úÖ No duplicates! All wines have unique post_urls')
"
```

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

Your system is working correctly if:

1. ‚úÖ **No duplicate post_urls** in database
2. ‚úÖ **All field edits work** without creating duplicates
3. ‚úÖ **Same URL twice** = skipped as duplicate
4. ‚úÖ **CLI and web** both add wines successfully
5. ‚úÖ **Export produces** updated wines.json
