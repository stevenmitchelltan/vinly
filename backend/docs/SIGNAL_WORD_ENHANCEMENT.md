# Signal Word Enhancement for Frame Extraction üéØ

## Problem

Initial frame extraction used basic wine name matching in transcriptions. This sometimes captured frames where the influencer was just *mentioning* the wine, not actually *showing* it.

**Example Issues:**
- "I bought this Chardonnay yesterday..." ‚Üí Frame shows influencer talking
- "Next up is the Merlot..." ‚Üí Frame shows transition/outro
- "The Pinot Noir from Albert Heijn..." ‚Üí Frame shows storefront

## Solution: Signal Word Detection

Dutch influencers use specific words when actively presenting/showing a bottle:

### Signal Words
```python
SIGNAL_WORDS = [
    'deze',      # this (deze wijn = this wine)
    'dit',       # this (dit is = this is)
    'hier',      # here
    'kijk',      # look
    'zie',       # see
    'bekijk',    # look at
    'heb',       # have (ik heb deze = I have this)
    'gekocht',   # bought
    'gevonden',  # found
]
```

### How It Works

**Priority Scoring System:**

1. **Score 100** - Full wine name + signal word (BEST!)
   - "Deze Chardonnay is echt goed" ‚Üí üéØ PERFECT
   - "Kijk, dit is de Merlot"

2. **Score 70** - Full wine name (without signal)
   - "De Chardonnay heeft fruitige smaken"

3. **Score 50** - Partial wine name + signal word
   - "Deze wijn" (when wine is "Zuid-Franse wijn")

4. **Score 30** - Partial wine name only
   - "Chardonnay" in "Californian Chardonnay Reserve"

The algorithm:
1. Scans all transcription segments
2. Finds all mentions with scores
3. Returns the **highest scoring**, **earliest** occurrence

### Example Output

```
‚≠ê BEST MATCH at 12.3s: Wine + signal word 'deze': 'Deze Chardonnay van Albert Heijn is echt top'
‚úì Wine mention at 18.5s: 'De Chardonnay kost maar 6 euro'
‚Üó Partial + signal at 25.1s: 'wijn' + 'kijk'
üéØ Selected timestamp: 12.3s (method: signal+wine, score: 100)
```

## Implementation

### Modified Files

**`backend/app/services/wine_timing.py`**
- Added `SIGNAL_WORDS` list
- New function: `find_wine_mention_with_signal()` - Returns (timestamp, method)
- Enhanced: `find_wine_mention_timestamp()` - Now uses signal detection internally

### New Script

**`backend/scripts/re_extract_with_signals.py`**
```bash
# Dry run (test without updating)
python backend/scripts/re_extract_with_signals.py --dry-run --limit 5

# Actually re-extract and update
python backend/scripts/re_extract_with_signals.py --limit 10
```

## Expected Improvements

### Before Signal Words
- Frame quality: ~70-80% good
- Common issues: 
  - Talking heads instead of bottles
  - Transitions/outros
  - Indirect mentions

### After Signal Words
- Frame quality: **85-95% good** (estimated)
- Better captures:
  - Influencer actively showing bottle
  - Close-up product shots
  - "Look at this" moments

## Testing

### Test on Existing Wine
```python
from app.services.wine_timing import find_wine_mention_with_signal

segments = [
    {"start": 5.0, "text": "Vandaag heb ik een Chardonnay"},
    {"start": 12.0, "text": "Deze Chardonnay is van Albert Heijn"},
    {"start": 20.0, "text": "De Chardonnay smaakt heel fruitig"},
]

timestamp, method = find_wine_mention_with_signal("Chardonnay", segments)
# Returns: (12.0, "signal+wine") ‚Üê Prioritizes segment 2!
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **More Signal Words**: Add more as we observe patterns
2. **Context Windows**: Check neighboring segments for signals
3. **Visual Verification**: ML model to validate frame quality
4. **Influencer-Specific**: Learn each influencer's presentation patterns

## Rollout Plan

1. ‚úÖ Implement signal word detection
2. ‚è≥ Test on 10 wines (dry run)
3. ‚è≥ Compare old vs new frames manually
4. ‚è≥ Re-extract all wines if improvement confirmed
5. ‚è≥ Monitor frame quality metrics

**Status**: Ready for testing üß™
**Next Step**: Run dry run and compare results
