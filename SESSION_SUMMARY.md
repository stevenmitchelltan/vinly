# Session Summary - Vinly Wine Discovery Platform

## Date: October 26, 2025

## Overview

Comprehensive development session transforming Vinly from a basic wine scraper into a production-ready wine discovery platform with advanced AI features and authentic bottle images.

---

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Supermarket-Only Filtering (Cost Optimization)

**What**: Pre-filter videos to only process those mentioning supermarkets  
**Why**: Save GPT costs by filtering out 79% of irrelevant content  
**Result**: Reduced API costs by 79%, process only 51/241 videos  

**Key Implementation:**
- Smart filter checks for supermarket keywords
- Case-sensitive "Plus/PLUS" handling to avoid false positives
- Filters before LLM processing

### 2. ✅ Audio Transcription with Whisper

**What**: Transcribe TikTok video audio to get full wine details  
**Why**: Captions are too short (200 chars) - audio has full reviews  
**Result**: 168% more wines extracted (31 → 83 wines)  

**Key Features:**
- Whisper API integration with retry logic
- Two-pass transcription with lexicon-guided prompts
- ASR metrics tracking (hits/1k, OOV rate, runtime)
- Cost: ~$0.37 for 61 minutes of audio

### 3. ✅ Enhanced LLM Wine Extraction

**What**: Improved GPT-4o-mini prompts for better extraction quality  
**Why**: Original prompts were generic and extracted incorrect wines  
**Result**: High-quality wines with better names, ratings, and descriptions  

**Prompt Improvements:**
- **Name normalization**: Corrects transcription errors (e.g., "Koteroon" → "Côtes du Rhône")
- **Strict supermarket validation**: Only extracts if supermarket explicitly mentioned
- **Single winner enforcement**: Max 1 wine per video
- **Ordering heuristic**: Prioritizes wines mentioned early (intro pattern)
- **Comparison handling**: Extracts only the winner from A vs B videos
- **Pronoun resolution**: "deze/die/dit" mapped to concrete wine names
- **Negative filtering**: Skips criticized wines
- **Enthusiastic ratings**: "echt een toppertje", "duidelijke winnaar" (not generic "aanrader")
- **Elaborate descriptions**: Full flavor profiles and tasting notes

### 4. ✅ Video Frame Extraction (Wine Bottle Images)

**What**: Extract bottle images from videos using timing data  
**Why**: Web scraping product images had 0-15% success rate  
**Result**: **100% success rate** - all 29 wines got authentic bottle images!  

**How It Works:**
1. Whisper provides word-level timestamps
2. Find when wine name is mentioned (e.g., "Chardonnay at 36.0s")
3. Extract frames 0.75-1.25 seconds after mention (influencer showing bottle)
4. Select best frame (file size > 10KB)
5. Save to `/static/wine_images/`

**Performance:**
- 4-7 seconds per wine
- 100% success rate
- No ML required
- Authentic images from actual videos

### 5. ⏸️ Product Link Feature (Attempted, Then Disabled)

**What**: Scrape supermarket websites for product URLs  
**Why**: Provide direct shopping links  
**Result**: Disabled due to 0-15% success rate and poor quality  

**What We Tried:**
- Static HTML scraping
- Playwright browser automation
- Multi-query search variations
- Fuzzy matching validation

**Why It Failed:**
- Modern supermarkets use JavaScript SPAs
- Anti-bot protection blocks automated requests
- Wine names too generic or don't match catalogs

**Decision**: Disabled feature, cleaned up all code

## Key Decisions & Lessons

### What Worked
✅ **Transcription over captions**: 168% improvement  
✅ **LLM prompt engineering**: Huge quality gains  
✅ **Video frame extraction**: 100% vs 0% from web scraping  
✅ **YAML configuration**: Easy to maintain and adjust  
✅ **Timing-based extraction**: No ML needed  

### What Didn't Work
❌ **Product link web scraping**: Modern web is too complex  
❌ **Playwright for scraping**: Too slow, inconsistent results  
❌ **Caption-only extraction**: Too little information  

### Smart Pivots
1. Started with captions → Added transcription (168% improvement)
2. Tried product links → Switched to video frames (0% → 100%)
3. Attempted complex scraping → Simplified to timing-based extraction
