## 🚀 Next Steps (Deploy Your App!)

### 1. Create Cloudinary Account
- Sign up at https://cloudinary.com (free, no credit card)
- Note your Cloud name, API key, API secret

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
- Go to repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
- Add 4 secrets:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
  - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
  - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
- Settings → Pages
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: main, Folder: /docs
- Save

### 4. Initial Data Migration (If You Have Existing Wines)

```bash
# Make sure Docker is running
docker-compose up -d

# Add Cloudinary credentials to .env
echo "CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name" >> backend/.env
echo "CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key" >> backend/.env
echo "CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret" >> backend/.env

# Restart backend to load new env vars
docker-compose restart backend

# Migrate existing images to Cloudinary (173 images)
docker exec vinly-backend python scripts/migrate_images_to_cloudinary.py

# Export current wines to JSON
docker exec vinly-backend python scripts/export_to_json.py

# Commit and push
git add docs/wines.json
git commit -m "Initial wine data for GitHub Pages"
git push
```

### 5. Trigger First Workflow Run
- Go to Actions tab
- Click "Update Wine Data"
- Click "Run workflow"
- Wait ~20-30 minutes
- Check your site at `yourusername.github.io/vinly`

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Local Development (Docker)
```
User → localhost:80 (Frontend)
         ↓
      localhost:8000 (Backend API)
         ↓
      MongoDB (Docker)
```

### Production (GitHub Pages)
```
User → yourusername.github.io/vinly (Frontend)
         ↓
      docs/wines.json (Static data)
         ↓
      Cloudinary CDN (Images)

GitHub Actions (Weekly Sunday 2am):
  ↓
  Scrape → Transcribe → Extract → Upload to Cloudinary
  ↓
  Update wines.json → Commit → Auto-deploy
```

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Service | Free Tier | Your Usage | Cost |
|---------|-----------|------------|------|
| GitHub Pages | 100GB bandwidth/mo | ~1-5GB/mo | $0 |
| GitHub Actions | 2000 min/mo | ~120 min/mo | $0 |
| Cloudinary | 25GB storage + bandwidth | ~2GB | $0 |
| OpenAI API | Pay per use | ~$5-10/mo | $5-10 |
| **Total** | | | **$5-10/mo** |

## 🎯 How It Works

### Weekly Automated Process

**Every Sunday at 2am UTC:**

1. **GitHub Actions triggers** 
2. **Spins up temporary Python + MongoDB**
3. **Scrapes TikTok** with Playwright
4. **Downloads videos** with yt-dlp
5. **Transcribes audio** with OpenAI Whisper (~$2-3)
6. **Extracts wines** with GPT-4o-mini (~$0.50)
7. **Extracts frames** with FFmpeg
8. **Uploads images** to Cloudinary CDN
9. **Exports wines.json**
10. **Commits to GitHub**
11. **GitHub Pages auto-deploys** (2-3 minutes)
12. **Cleanup** (destroys MongoDB)

**Result:** Fresh wines on your site, zero manual work!

### Local Development

**When you run `docker-compose up`:**
- Backend serves API at http://localhost:8000
- Frontend loads from API (not static JSON)
- MongoDB stores data locally
- Images saved locally (not uploaded to Cloudinary)

**Perfect for:**
- Testing changes
- Developing new features
- Running scripts manually

## 🔄 Workflows Comparison

| Aspect | GitHub Pages (Production) | Docker (Local Dev) |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages CDN | localhost |
| **Data** | Static JSON file | MongoDB database |
| **Images** | Cloudinary CDN | Local files |
| **Updates** | Automated (weekly) | Manual scripts |
| **Cost** | ~$5-10/mo | $0 (runs locally) |
| **Speed** | Instant (static) | Instant (local) |
| **Setup** | 15 min one-time | 5 min install |

## 📊 File Sizes

**Current state:**
- 31 wines in database
- 173 images (32MB) → Will move to Cloudinary
- wines.json: ~50KB
- Total git repo after cleanup: <5MB

**After migration:**
- wines.json: ~50KB (in repo)
- Images: 0 bytes (on Cloudinary, not in repo)
- Git repo: <2MB (no images!)

---

## ✅ Benefits of This Approach

**vs Backend Deployment (Render, Railway):**
- ✅ No server costs (GitHub Pages is free)
- ✅ No cold starts (static site loads instantly)
- ✅ No backend maintenance
- ✅ Simpler deployment (just push to GitHub)
- ✅ Better performance (global CDN)
- ✅ No database hosting needed

**vs Storing Images in Git:**
- ✅ Repo stays small (<5MB vs >500MB)
- ✅ Fast git operations
- ✅ Images on global CDN (faster worldwide)
- ✅ Auto image optimization (Cloudinary)
- ✅ Unlimited scaling (10,000+ wines possible)

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance

**Zero maintenance required!**

GitHub Actions runs automatically every Sunday. You can:
- Monitor workflow runs in Actions tab
- Manually trigger if needed
- View logs if something fails

**Common tasks:**

```bash
# Manually trigger update
# → Go to Actions tab → Run workflow

# Add new influencer
# → Edit backend/scripts/seed_tiktok_influencers.py
# → Push changes

# Change schedule
# → Edit .github/workflows/update-wines.yml
# → Modify cron expression

# Export current data
docker exec vinly-backend python scripts/export_to_json.py
git add docs/wines.json
git commit -m "Update wines"
git push
```
